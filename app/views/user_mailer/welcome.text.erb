Hello, residents of Apartment <%= @user.apartment_number %>

Thank you for signing up!

111WBroughtonStreet.com is here to help residents communicate with one another, as well as collectively address common issues such as noise, security, etc.

Here are a few things for you to know:

- The main purpose of this website is for residents to share information and address issues together as a community.
- This website is not affiliated in any way to Coastline Property Management. It is built and managed entirely by the residents of 111 W Broughton Street.
- This means that whatever you decide to post on this website will remain anonymous
- It also means that Coastline Property Managemen will not be able to see what you post, so if you have an issue you would like resolved, you still need to go through their tenant portal.

If you have any feedback or questions, you can reach the group's administrator at broughtonstreetresidents@gmail.com.

;)
